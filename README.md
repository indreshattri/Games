# Games
Making games is best way of getting familiar with javascript for a beginner.
I have made 3 games which are implemented using basics of bootstrap, canvas from html5 and javascript.

Snake and mouse is the first game which is the most easiest one to understand and to have gist of javascript.
Flappy Box gives you the exact experience of Flappy bird
